Here is the updated `README.md`. It focuses strictly on the technical reality of the two-channel system and the specific workflow of handling secrets, without the fluff.

# Sheriff Claw 🤠
**The Secure Way to Use Autonomous AI Agents**

Sheriff Claw is a security layer that sits between your AI agent and your sensitive data. It allows you to use powerful AI tools without giving them access to your passwords or API keys.

## 🚀 Quick Install (macOS)

Copy and paste this one line into your terminal and hit Enter:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Gazman-Dev/sheriffclaw/raw/main/install_sheriffclaw.sh | bash
```

_This script downloads Sheriff Claw, installs it, and guides you through the setup._

Here are the two updated sections for your README:

## 🔒 How It Works: The Two Channels

Sheriff Claw uses **two separate Telegram channels** to keep your digital life safe.

1.  **The Sheriff Channel (Secure Control):**
    This is a private line between you and the **Sheriff**, a secure computer program running on your machine. **The Sheriff is not an AI**; it is a strict security guard that manages your secrets and permissions.

2.  **The AI Channel (The Worker):**
    This is where you chat with your **AI Agent**. You can ask it to do amazing things like:
    *   "Research the latest tech news and write a summary."
    *   "Check my calendar and book a meeting."
    *   "Write code to fix a bug in my website."

The AI is smart and capable, but because it lives in a separate channel, it cannot access the secrets in the Sheriff's vault.

### 🔑 The Secure Workflow

Here is exactly how you can let the AI manage your accounts without ever giving it your password. Let's say you want the AI to **post a daily tweet about trending news**:

1.  **You ask the AI:** "Please check the news and tweet the top story every morning."
2.  **The AI checks its tools:** It realizes it needs an **X (Twitter) Token** to post on your behalf, but it doesn't have it.
3.  **The Sheriff alerts you:** The AI asks the Sheriff for help. The Sheriff immediately messages you on the **Secure Sheriff Channel**: *"The AI needs an X Token to proceed. Please provide it."*
4.  **You provide the secret:** You paste the token directly into the secure chat with the Sheriff.
5.  **The Sheriff locks it away:** The Sheriff encrypts the token in its vault and tells the AI, *"I have the token. You may proceed."*
6.  **The AI works safely:** The AI generates the tweet and sends the text to the Sheriff. The Sheriff takes the token from the vault, signs the message, and posts it to X.

**The Result:** The tweet is posted, but **the AI never saw your token.** It simply used the Sheriff to get the job done safely.

### 🛡️ Why This is Safer

*   **Immune to Trickery:** Since the Sheriff is a rigid program and not an AI, it cannot be tricked into revealing your secrets by a malicious website or a clever prompt.
*   **Encrypted Storage:** Your secrets are not saved in plain text files that the AI can read. They are encrypted with a Master Password that only you know.
*   **Total Separation:** Because the AI and the Sheriff live in different channels, the AI has no physical way to access the raw data inside the Sheriff's vault.
